        <h2>How You Can Contribute</h2>
        <h3>I found a bug/typo</h3>
        Post an issue at <a href="https://github.com/none-None1/Interpret-Esolangs-Online">GitHub</a> or talk in the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Talk:Interpret_Esolangs_Online">talk page at esolangs.org</a>. You can send a pull request if you already know how to fix the bug.
        <h3>I want a new esolang/feature</h3>
        It's like the above but you can give me a <b>public domain</b> interpreter (preferably client-side JS) as well. If you want to send a pull request to add an esolang, here is how to do that:
        <li>Add a JavaScript file for the language, it contains a function that takes the program and the input and returns the output, like this:</li>
        <pre>
            function yourlang(program,input){
                //code here...
                return output;
            }
        </pre>
        If the interpreter is in other languages but can be called from JavaScript (like C by using Emscripten), the JavaScript file should call the interpreter.

        The function name should not be the same with function names for existing esolangs.

        If you have a Python interpreter, add a Python file to link in the about.html file in the last step, and add a JavaScript file that calls the Python code (not the Python file) just like pyexec_example.html.
        <li>Add an <code>option</code> tag inside the <code>select</code> tag in the index.html file, the text should be the language name, like this:</li>
        <pre>
            &lt;option&gt;YourLang&lt;/option&gt;
        </pre>
        The <code>option</code> tags should then be sorted by text, lexicographically.
        <li>Add a <code>script</code> tag in the index.html file, the source is the JavaScript file you created in the first step, like this:</li>
        <pre>
            &lt;script defer src=&quot;yourlang.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
        <code>script</code> tags should be sorted by their sources, in lexicographical order, just like the <code>option</code> tags.
        <li></li>In the <code>run</code> function, add a line of code that maps the option of the new esolang to the function, like this:</li>
        <pre>
            funcs["YourLang"]=yourlang;
        </pre>

        <li>Finally, add the link to the language in the README.md file and add a row for this language in the about.html file, and update the number of languages and the version number.</li>
        Please do <b>NOT</b> do anything else or you'll mess up the repository!
